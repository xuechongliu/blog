As you might have seen, I've started a new company in 2012: [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)

Coinbase is an electronic wallet for the digital currency [bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), which I believe is going to be one of the most important new technologies changing the world in the coming years.  During the summer of 2012 I got accepted to Y Combinator (a startup incubator here in Silicon Valley), left my job at Airbnb (which is an amazing company btw, they were very supportive), and started working on Coinbase full time.

So far it's been really exciting.  We raised a $600k seed round, closed a deal with a major U.S. bank, and have been growing transaction volume about 15% per week.  There are all sorts of new things I'm learning as a CEO (slash software engineer).

<strong>So what does this mean for this blog?</strong>

It means that I will be doing most of my writing in the future at [http://blog.coinabse.com](http://blog.coinbase.com) - so you should subscribe there if you'd like to keep getting updates.

Thank you for a wonderful 2012 (it has definitely been the most exciting year in my life to date) and I'm looking forward to an even more exciting 2013!
